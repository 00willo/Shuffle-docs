# App development exercises 
App development is hard to get into, but easy once you understand it.

## Introduction

## Python apps 
1. **App setup:** Make an app with the name "Shuffle Learning", and add a custom image to it, then load it into Shuffle
2. **Add an action:** Make an action with the name "hello world", which returns "Hello world"
3. **Using parameters:** Add a new function called "say hi", which takes ONE input parameter, name, and returns "Hi, {name}"
4. **Using option parameters:** Add a new function called "true or false" which takes two options and compares them. Name the parameters "option1" and "option2", and make them use the "options" parameter operator, with the "true and false" values.
5. **Using KV store:** Make a function which sets the current time in the cache/KV store based on a key. Make another action for GETTING a value from the KV store. 
6. **Using Files:**
7. **Custom operations:** Build an app which can run nmap - either from python directly, or as a subprocess in the container. e.g. run it with this input: ```nmap 192.168.0.0/24 -T5```
