# Introduction
This is the start of a handbook that is publicly available, outlining how Shuffle is approaching the future of automation. We believe accessibility is key, and with a distributed group of workers, documentation is a huge part of that. Feel free to read, share and contribute. 

Please make a merge request to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Please use issues to ask questions. Lots of inspiration from [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/)'s handbook.
