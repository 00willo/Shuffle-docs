## Company
Shuffle exists to make automation accessible to everyone through collaboration. What this means is that we take the open source- and sharing aspect of our mission really seriously, and will share all we can in order to make the world safer. 

We were started to solve real-world issues for modern security operation centers, and intend to stay on that mission until it's finished. 

### History
#### 2019: Start of Shuffle
Shuffle was started by Fredrik as a hobby project to solve issues his own team was experiencing in incident response. He found other projects attempting similar things, but found them to not do what they promised, whether that was through usability or features, and set out to fix that. How hard could it be? 

#### 2020: Becoming Open Source
Shuffle was built without outside knowledge until May 2020, when it was Open Sourced. We saw a huge amount of interest from around the world, which gave us motivation to keep going. We started building out a community, blogging, making training material, documentation, and everything else that needs to come together for a project like Shuffle. 

We simultaneously got our first early adopters and [partner](https://shuffler.io/blog/infopercept) in late 2020, which made it possible to soon quit all other activity.

#### 2021: Going fulltime
With a good partnership, and a few early adopters, 2021 will be the year we start working fulltime on Shuffle. The potential is huge, and we see the possibility of real change in the security automation (SOAR) market.
