# Discord Support 
Discord is the community and communication platform of choice by Shuffle. 

## Introduction
Every community needs a home. For us, that's Discord. Discord is a versatile communication platforms built for gamers, which incidentally, a lot of security and IT people are. It fits well for our needs and community, hence is and will be the location of choice. This document is built out in order to understand how we (generally) use it, what access roles people have, and what they mean. It is intended for people helping our users, either as employees of Shuffle, through partnerships, or otherwise interested in community management.

There is no rulebook for how to talk to people; being kind and helpful goes a long way! 

Further suggestions for usage are always open - don't use this document as a rulebook!

## Getting familiar
**What do our roles mean?**
* Orange: This is Shuffle's color. If you're this role, you should have full access (admin) to control the Discord channel. Don't overuse it ;)
	- Special rights: Full server control. Basically an admin.
* Green: For contributors. See someone making an impact, whether through code or by helping? Give them this role and send them a nice message in a DM! Ensure people are appreciated. People should be a poweruser before reaching this role in MOST cases. 
	- Special rights: None
* Red: Powerusers. These are marked as people who can definitely use Shuffle, but haven't done any real contributions yet. This is the stepping stone role to becoming a contributor, and eventually admin.
	- Special rights: None 
* Blue: Project Sponsors. These are people who give monetary help to Shuffle, however small or big. Gives access to a private chatroom.
	- Special rights: A sponsor chat. This is inactive, hence may be removed.
* Pink: Discord Boosters.
	- Special rights: None 
* Grey: Everyone else.
	- Special rights: None 

**Here's a short description for each of the channels:**
* General: Where people are invited to; the starting point. Here we discuss pretty much anything about Shuffle or in security.
* Announcement: Where we publish important information about new releases to ensure everyone sees them. 
* Rules: Our rules. These will be expanded if necessary.
* Product-Updates: Automated webhooks from Github and Dockerhub about new pull requests, issues, comments and the like.
* Community-Releases: Has to do with Shuffle Cloud. Whenever a new app or workflow is released, it will be mentioned here. These messages are controlled by a Shuffle Workflow.
* Sponsorchat: A chat for sponsors. Not really in use.
* Workflows: Discussion about Shuffle workflows - how they work, are built etc.
* Integrations: Discussions about Shuffle apps - how they work, are built etc.
* Python-Dev: Discussions for development of python apps for Shuffle. 
* Liquid-Formatting: Discussions around how to use Liquid Formatting in Shuffle.
* Writeups: Writeups for Shuffle, both from Shuffle and externals.
* Resources: Extra resources for Shuffle, both from us and others.

There are more channels as well - for internal use. These are visible only to admins, and are being used for and by the Shuffle team only.

## Knowledge base
Shuffle's knowledge-base is currently being built in the [Shuffle-Docs repository on Github](https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-docs). All information is presented using Markdown. All information present in the shuffle-docs repository is further searchable on the [https://shuffler.io](https://shuffler.io) website.

- If a question is asked in Discord or otherwise, we always suggest linking straight to the resource while answering the question.
- If the question doesn't have an answer documented; document it! Find the right document and update it. 
- If there is any sensitive information to be handled, tell them to send it to you in a DM, or through a different channel.

## Promotions / Demotions
See any extraordinary work or accomplishment by someone? 
- Promote and cheer for them! Help them share their knowledge :)

Got a problem with a user? Are they inactive? Spamming? Being insensitive?
- Mute them as per the rules. Take up the problems with other admins to see what can further be done.
