# Introduction
As a newly started company, culture is of huge importance, and something to be properly established by the early team. Shuffle works with internal employees, a community of security professionals, customers and partners, and aim to bring an energetic vibe to each of these interactions. 

## Helping open source
We're believers in community and open source, and believe access and transparency to be necessary for our growth. Actively communicating with users and customers is of great importance, as it proves that our work is important, and that we should keep going. 

Our most important goal is to make the world more secure through automation. 

## All-remote work
Shuffle is and will be established as an all-remote company. We're figuring out how this will work with early hires, and are excited to bring on board a wide variety of people from around the globe.

There are a lot of advantages to being remote, and we'll help you understand them as we figure out the landscape. Here are my (Fredrik) favorite reason we're remote:
* **Work from anywhere, any time**:
	- We don't require you to work at a specific location, nor at a specific time. We aim to give you the flexibility to do what you like, when you like, and have ownership over what you produce.
