## Introduction
Apps, also referred to actions actions in some cases, are the heavy lifters of [workflows](/docs/workflows) within Shuffle. They give the user access to a library of pre-defined integrations, and are also easy to recreate for any user. Apps are based on the same format as [WALKOFF](https://walkoff.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apps.html), and are therefore interchangable between the two. 

## How they work
Apps are the building blocks used of workflows, and are either made by us (Shuffle) or our users. These can be auto-generated from [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/), through predefined python libraries, and are (for now) made with Python. Currently available apps can be found at [https://shuffler.io/apps](https://shuffler.io/apps).
