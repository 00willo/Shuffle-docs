# About
Shuffle started as a project in mid-2019 because of a few automation related problems that needed more attention in the [CERT/SIRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_emergency_response_team) community. Available automation solutions in the security industry are trying to do everything; handle tickets, indicators, threat intel and much more in a single platform, while our goal is to build the best solution to fit all your existing tools following the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well): "Do One Thing and Do It Well". In our case that is tool integration, giving the user access to anything they might need to integrate their existing tools.

## Problems we solve
These included, but were not limited to (no specific order):
* [Alert fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alarm_fatigue) by giving analysts the tools to automate most alerts
* Simple deployment of new code to your existing tech stack
* Quick integrations with new tools / vendors and an overview of existing tools
* Clear overview of what is happening (usually lacking QA/testing)
<!--* Easy reporting of current integration%} This is on the roadmap -->
<!--* Replayability - This will come -->
