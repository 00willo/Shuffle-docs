# About
Shuffle started as a project in mid-2019 because of a few automation related problems that needed more attention in the [CERT/SIRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_emergency_response_team) community. Available automation solutions in the security industry are trying to do everything at once; handle tickets, indicators, threat intel and much more in a single platform, while our goal is to build the best solution to fit all your existing tools following the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well): "Do One Thing and Do It Well". 

## Open Source
After a long time of no activity, I decided to open source Shuffle. The cloud version is still intact, but focus will move away from it for a while.

* Quick integrations with new tools - OpenAPI
* Giving you a clear overview of your environment by tracking integration usage
